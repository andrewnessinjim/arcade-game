# Arcade Game - Udacity Nanodegree Project

This a learning project which focuses on using ES2015 features efficiently. Check out [this course][1] if you're interesting in learning to build/contribute to similar projects.

The project is built using [gulp][2]. [Babel][3] is used to transpile the ES2015 code so it can work in browsers that don't support them. [RequireJS][4] is used for ES2015 modules. [Bower][5] is used to pull dependencies that run in the browser. [npm][6] is used to pull dependencies that are needed to setup the gulp pipeline for the project. [eslint][7] is setup to catch errors as you type.
